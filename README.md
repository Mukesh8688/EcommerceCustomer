# EcommerceCustomer

We will be using Linear Regression to advise a (fake) Ecommerce company which is taken from kaggle  that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.

The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website.

We'll first explore this data, before using Linear Regression to study the correlations between the different factors and how they affect the how much the customer spends.

Afterthat, we also focus how to evaluate model by different types of metrics and how to understand meaning of score which is given by metrics. This is primary reasons of this projects.
